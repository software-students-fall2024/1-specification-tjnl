## Stakeholders

In designing this app, we interviewed Kevin, who is entering his second year as a resident in the Lafayette residence hall. He is also a Tandon student, and, as such, commutes between the Brooklyn and Manhattan campuses often. Through this discussion, we identified the following.

Needs: 

1. Get to class on time.
2. Commute between the Manhattan and Brooklyn campuses.
3. Identify all available transportation options.
4. Find the most optimal means of transportation between NYU buildings.

Problems:

1. There is no unified view of public and NYU transportation.
2. NYU bus schedules change very often and are hard to keep track of.
3. The time to make a decision can cause people to miss out on the fastest option.
4. It is hard to get feedback on different transportation options.

## Product Vision Statement

Our app will present a unified, feedback driven view of transportation options between NYU campus locations, integrating both public and NYU services to provide the best commuting experience.

## User Requirements

As an NYU student, I want to search for the fastest route so that I can get to class on time.

As a member of the NYU community, I want to view previous trips so that I do not have to reenter trip information.
 
As a member of the NYU community, I want to rate trips immediately when they end so that I can give accurate feedback.
 
As a member of the NYU community, I want to view how routes are being rated so that I can choose the best one.
 
As an NYU student, I want to only view routes between NYU buildings, so that I can quickly navigate the campus without getting distracted by non-university locations.

As a member of the NYU community, I want to be able to plan commutes on weekends, when there is limited service for most transit options. 

As a member of the NYU community, I want to see the times of the buses, trains, and shuttles that are nearby or get me to my destination.

As a member of the NYU community, I want to be able to call SafeRide immediately when needed so that I can get home safely during late hours.

As a member of the NYU community, I want to be able to choose between various commute options, depending on weather, time, or just how I am feeling.

As a member of the NYU community, I want to be able to commute to other NYU buildings, and will need to rely on this app for transportation across neighborhoods or even boroughs.
